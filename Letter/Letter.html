        <div class="greeting">Dear Jason,</div>
        
            <p> I&apos;m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14,
                2020.</p>
            <p>I&apos;ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. I&apos;m
                tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.</p>
            <p> I&apos;ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It&apos;s rare to
                find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a
                positive, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.</p>
            <p> I&apos;m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your
                support has meant so much to me. </p>
            <p>Please let me know if there&apos;s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.</p>
        <div class="closing">
            Thanks, and best wishes, <br>
            Nicole Thomas (signature hard copy letter) <br>
